Many things can be done off-line, like generating an understanding of the paper and compose a feed. 

It's not a real-time workflow, but can generate a few templates or find users with parallel interests, then mimic

Pipeline should look like:
1. get interest queries(field of study/keywords/author names/journal/conference names)
2. mode: survey / update in the field
3. get papers[check if has been downloaded, if not download, with id]
4. process papers: generate understanding if not, compose feed
5. save feed
6. update feed
